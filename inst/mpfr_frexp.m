%
% Set EXP (formally, the value pointed to by EXP) and Y such that
% 0.5<=abs(Y)<1 and Y times 2 raised to EXP equals X rounded to the
% precision of Y, using the given rounding mode.  If X is zero, then
% Y is set to a zero of the same sign and EXP is set to 0.  If X is
% NaN or an infinity, then Y is set to the same value and EXP is
% undefined.
