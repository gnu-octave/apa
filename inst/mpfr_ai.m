function ret = mpfr_ai (rop, x, rnd)
% Set ROP to the value of the Airy function Ai on X, rounded in the
% direction RND.  When X is NaN, ROP is always set to NaN.  When X is
% +Inf or âˆ’Inf, ROP is +0.  The current implementation is not
% intended to be used with large arguments.  It works with abs(X)
% typically smaller than 500.  For larger arguments, other methods
% should be used and will be implemented in a future version.
