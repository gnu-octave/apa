function ret = mpfr_check_range (x, t, rnd)
% ret = mpfr_check_range (x, t, rnd)
%
% This function assumes that X is the correctly rounded value of some
% real value Y in the direction RND and some extended exponent range,
% and that T is the corresponding *note ternary value::.  For
% example, one performed ‘t = mpfr_log (x, u, rnd)’, and Y is the
% exact logarithm of U.  Thus T is negative if X is smaller than Y,
% positive if X is larger than Y, and zero if X equals Y.  This
% function modifies X if needed to be in the current range of
% acceptable values: It generates an underflow or an overflow if the
% exponent of X is outside the current allowed range; the value of T
% may be used to avoid a double rounding.  This function returns zero
% if the new value of X equals the exact one Y, a positive value if
% that new value is larger than Y, and a negative value if it is
% smaller than Y.  Note that unlike most functions, the new result X
% is compared to the (unknown) exact one Y, not the input value X,
% i.e., the ternary value is propagated.
%
% Note: If X is an infinity and T is different from zero (i.e., if
% the rounded result is an inexact infinity), then the overflow flag
% is set.  This is useful because ‘mpfr_check_range’ is typically
% called (at least in MPFR functions) after restoring the flags that
% could have been set due to internal computations.
