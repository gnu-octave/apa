% Set ROP to the value of the first kind Bessel function of order 0,
% (resp. 1 and N) on OP, rounded in the direction RND.  When OP is
% NaN, ROP is always set to NaN.  When OP is plus or minus Infinity,
% ROP is set to +0.  When OP is zero, and N is not zero, ROP is set
% to +0 or âˆ’0 depending on the parity and sign of N, and the sign of
% OP.
