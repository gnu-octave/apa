% Set ROP to the value of the Gamma function on OP, resp.  the
% incomplete Gamma function on OP and OP2, rounded in the direction
% RND.  (In the literature, ‘mpfr_gamma_inc’ is called upper
% incomplete Gamma function, or sometimes complementary incomplete
% Gamma function.)  For ‘mpfr_gamma’ (and ‘mpfr_gamma_inc’ when OP2
% is zero), when OP is a negative integer, ROP is set to NaN.
%
% Note: the current implementation of ‘mpfr_gamma_inc’ is slow for
% large values of ROP or OP, in which case some internal overflow
% might also occur.
