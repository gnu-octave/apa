function ret = mpfr_rec_sqrt (rop, op, rnd)
% ret = mpfr_rec_sqrt (rop, op, rnd)
%
% Set ROP to the reciprocal square root of OP rounded in the
% direction RND.  Set ROP to +Inf if OP is ±0, +0 if OP is +Inf, and
% NaN if OP is negative.  Warning!  Therefore the result on −0 is
% different from the one of the rSqrt function recommended by the
% IEEE 754-2008 standard (Section 9.2.1), which is −Inf instead of
% +Inf.
