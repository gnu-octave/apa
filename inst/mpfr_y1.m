function ret = mpfr_y1 (rop, op, rnd)
% Set ROP to the value of the second kind Bessel function of order 0
% (resp. 1 and N) on OP, rounded in the direction RND.  When OP is
% NaN or negative, ROP is always set to NaN.  When OP is +Inf, ROP is
% set to +0.  When OP is zero, ROP is set to +Inf or âˆ’Inf depending
% on the parity and sign of N.
