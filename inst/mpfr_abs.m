function ret = mpfr_abs (rop, op, rnd)
% ret = mpfr_abs (rop, op, rnd)
%
% Set ROP to -OP and the absolute value of OP respectively, rounded
% in the direction RND.  Just changes or adjusts the sign if ROP and
% OP are the same variable, otherwise a rounding might occur if the
% precision of ROP is less than that of OP.
%
% The sign rule also applies to NaN in order to mimic the IEEE 754
% ‘negate’ and ‘abs’ operations, i.e., for ‘mpfr_neg’, the sign is
% reversed, and for ‘mpfr_abs’, the sign is set to positive.  But
% contrary to IEEE 754, the NaN flag is set as usual.
