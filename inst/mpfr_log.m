function ret = mpfr_log (rop, op, rnd)
% ret = mpfr_log (rop, op, rnd)
%
% Set ROP to the natural logarithm of OP, log2(OP) or log10(OP),
% respectively, rounded in the direction RND.  Set ROP to +0 if OP is
% 1 (in all rounding modes), for consistency with the ISO C99 and
% IEEE 754-2008 standards.  Set ROP to −Inf if OP is ±0 (i.e., the
% sign of the zero has no influence on the result).
