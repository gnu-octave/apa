%
% Set ROP to the arithmetic-geometric mean of OP1 and OP2, rounded in
% the direction RND.  The arithmetic-geometric mean is the common
% limit of the sequences U_N and V_N, where U_0=OP1, V_0=OP2, U_(N+1)
% is the arithmetic mean of U_N and V_N, and V_(N+1) is the geometric
% mean of U_N and V_N.  If any operand is negative and the other one
% is not zero, set ROP to NaN.  If any operand is zero and the other
% one is finite (resp. infinite), set ROP to +0 (resp. NaN).
