function mpfr_set_prec (x, prec)
% mpfr_set_prec (x, prec)
%
% Set the precision of X to be *exactly* PREC bits, and set its value
% to NaN.  The previous value stored in X is lost.  It is equivalent
% to a call to ‘mpfr_clear(x)’ followed by a call to ‘mpfr_init2(x,
% prec)’, but more efficient as no allocation is done in case the
% current allocated space for the significand of X is enough.  The
% precision PREC can be any integer between ‘MPFR_PREC_MIN’ and
% ‘MPFR_PREC_MAX’.  In case you want to keep the previous value
% stored in X, use ‘mpfr_prec_round’ instead.
%
% Warning!  You must not use this function if X was initialized with
% ‘MPFR_DECL_INIT’ or with ‘mpfr_custom_init_set’ (*note Custom
% Interface::).
